# LightBnB

## Description

Lighthouse BnB is an app that will revolutionize the travel industry. It will allow homeowners to rent out their homes to people on vacation, creating an alternative to hotels and bed and breakfasts...Thereâ€™s nothing else like it!

We'll be creating the first ever application to do something like this and we will call it LighthouseBnB.
